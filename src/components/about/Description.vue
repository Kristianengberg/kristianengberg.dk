            My name is Kristian. I am a full-stack web developer. I have many years of experience with a plethora of technologies. I got my introduction to programming working with Processing, a Java like program.
            I then moved on to making visual projects in the game engine Unity. In my later years of university I started getting fascinated with Machine Learning and spent
            the greater part of a year making Machine Learning Projects, mainly Reinforcement Learning, I had to get permission to focus my Bachelor on Reinforcement Learning, as it was not a part of the Education Plan.
            When I started my studies at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology, Web development,
            mainly back-end development, became a big part of my developer life. The realisation of how much work gets done behind the scenes to make programs and website do what we want them to do
            was very intriguing. I got introduced to Java as a back-end language and worked with Spring and Hibernate. I moved on to NodeJS afterwards and learned how JavaScript can be used on the server.
            Having learned back-end frameworks I decided I needed to learn something for the front-end. Creating websites with just HTML5, CSS and JavaScript became extremely tedious. I became very fond of
            VueJS and have been using it ever since. I am really excited about the concepts of component based frameworks and it has sped up my development time ten folds.

            In my sparetime I love being with friends and have devoted a big part of my life to our Men's Club, GSV15. Besides that I have played guitar since I was 9 and I will almost always listen to music.
            I try to workout in the gym as much as I can to make sure I stay in a somewhat decent shape. I do not really do it for the bodybuilding aspect, but I do love to lift heavy weights.
            I play around with electronics as well and have so many Arduinos lying around, I really need to find a way to organise them better.
